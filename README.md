# Lyric-based-song-recommendation-system

This project is a lyric-based music recommendation system built with Streamlit.
Instead of relying on genres, artists, or metadata, it analyzes the lyrics of songs to recommend tracks with similar themes, moods, and word patterns.

Users can:
	‚Ä¢	Enter a song title or paste lyrics.
	‚Ä¢	Get recommendations for songs with similar lyrical content.
	‚Ä¢	Explore the semantic meaning of lyrics using NLP techniques.
